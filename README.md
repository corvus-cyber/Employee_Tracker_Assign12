# Employee_Tracker_Assign12

# Description 
This assignment takes mySQL, javascript and node.js and taught me how to build a terminal-based application that can connect to a database, allowing the application to reference, edit, add or delete information from SQL. 

Upon following the proper usage steps (see below) the application will allow the user to add departments, roles and employees to the database, view those different categories and update a chosen Employee's role. For bonus work I was also able to make it so that the user could update the chosen employee's manager and delete data from any of the three chosen categories (employee, role or department).

I built this project in order to test my newfound knowledge of SQL and apply it into creating an inquirer based application within the terminal.
